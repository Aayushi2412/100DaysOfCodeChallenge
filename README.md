# 100DaysOfCodeChallenge
I am taking up the challenge of 100 days of Code, so that I can develop a regular habit of coding everyday thereby improving my coding skills. It starts from 16th of May 2023.
I have chosen this challenge to improve my coding skills and build a habit of consistent coding. I will be documenting my progress on this GitHub repository and sharing it on Linkedln using the hashtag #100daysofcodechallenge.
